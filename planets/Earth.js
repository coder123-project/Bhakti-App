          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the
          universe where life has originated and found habitability. While Earth
          may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only
          Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the Earth
          with its ocean, making Earth an ocean world. Earth's polar regions
          currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice
          covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers
          and atmospheric water. Land, consisting of continents and islands,
          extends over 29.2% of the Earth and is widely covered by vegetation.
          Below Earth's surface material lies Earth's crust consisting of
          several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce
          mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core
          generates a magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth,
          largely deflecting destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

          Earth has an atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and
          protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a
          composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely
          present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the
          planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with
          other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide
          (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water
          vapour to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.
          This process maintains the current average surface temperature of
          14.76Â°C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure.
          Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic
          regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than
          the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a
          global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of
          weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as
          nitrogen to cycle.

          Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about
          40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four
          rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about
          eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year
          (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The Earth rotates
          around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and
          56 minutes). The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to
          the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing
          seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the
          Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is
          roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon
          always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes tides,
          stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

          Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion
          years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion
          years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed
          within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's
          atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two
          billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached
          a population of 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere
          and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly
          impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on
          Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the
          livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, causing widespread
          extinctions.
